[*(klaku Ä‰i tie por klarigoj en Esperanto)*](per-patchlunky.md)

Patchlunky is a program that allows you to install and manage various mods in Spelunky. It automatically makes backups of the unmodded files for you, and it's easy to quickly install and uninstall mods.

### Summary:

Go to [the download page of Patchlunky](https://github.com/Worst-vd-plas/Patchlunky/releases) and download the latest version. Unpack the zip file where you want to install Patchlunky.

Go to [the download page of the Esperanto translation](https://github.com/Rajzin/Spelunky-Esperanto-traduko/releases/) and download the latest version of the zip file with "por patchlunky kaj spelunktool" in the name. Take the translation zip file, go to the folder where you unpacked Patchlunky, and put the zip file (without unpacking it) in the folder "Mods".

Open Patchlunky.exe, and install it normally.

#### To install the Esperanto translation:
In Patchlunky, select "Esperanto traduko" in the list (and any other mod you want to install with it), and push "Patch Game".

#### To uninstall the Esperanto translation:
In Patchlunky, go to the tab "Settings" and click "Restore default game files".


### Detailed steps:

1. Make sure that you have Spelunky installed, via Steam or GOG. (Without any other mods installed!)
2. Go to [the download page of Patchlunky](https://github.com/Worst-vd-plas/Patchlunky/releases) and download the latest version.
3. Unpack the zip file where you want to install Patchlunky.

4. Go to [the download page of the Esperanto translation](https://github.com/Rajzin/Spelunky-Esperanto-traduko/releases/) and download the latest version of the zip file with "por patchlunky kaj spelunktool" in the name.
5. Take the translation zip file, go to the folder where you unpacked Patchlunky, and put the zip file (without unpacking it) in the folder "Mods".

6. In the folder "Patchlunky", open "Patchlunky.exe".

7. This window will pop up. If you click "Yes", Patchlunky will probably automatically find the right folder. If you click "No", Patchlunky will ask whether you want to manually locate the Spelunky directory.

8. Next this window will pop up. Click "Yes" if you want to back up now. Click "No" if you want to do it later (at Settings -> Setup Patchlunky). If you make it back up the game files, Patchlunky is now ready to install the mod.

9. To install the translation, check the box next to "Esperanto traduko", and click "Patch Game". (Do NOT have the game running as you do this!)
10. Done!

Open Spelunky (with the "Launch Game" button, or however you usually open the game), and it'll work.

If before installing the mod you played Spelunky in another language than English, you have to go to the settings and change the language to Esperanto there.

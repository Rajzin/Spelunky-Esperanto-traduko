# Spelunky in Esperanto

This is a mod for playing Spelunky in Esperanto. (Spelunky HD for Windows, to be exact.) It adds Esperanto letters and replaces all English texts with Esperanto.

This is still the beta version of my translation, as there are probably still a few mistakes here and there. You can send corrections and any other suggestions you might have at @Spenchjo in Telegram, or by email at spenchjo&nbsp;[at]&nbsp;gmail.com

If you want to proofread the translation, the [provlega listo](https://github.com/Rajzin/Spelunky-Esperanto-traduko/blob/master/provlega%20listo.txt) should be useful. It's a list of all texts in both English and Esperanto. See also my [translation notes](https://github.com/Rajzin/Spelunky-Esperanto-traduko/blob/master/tradukaj%20notoj.txt) (in Esperanto) for explanations about the choices I made in my translation.

## How to install

There are three ways to install the mod:

1. [Simple instalation](howtoinstall-simple.md) - the fastest and easiest way to install.
2. [Installation with Patchlunky](howtoinstall-patchlunky.md) - the safest way to install. You'll have less chance that you accidentally mess something up in the game files. With this method it's also easy to combine this mod with other mods.
3. [Permana instalo per Spelunktool](howtoinstall-spelunktool.md) - the nerdiest way to install. With this method you have the most control.

## How to get the game

Before you install the Esperanto translation, you need to own the game first. You can buy the game [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/239350/Spelunky/) on Steam, or [here](https://www.gog.com/game/spelunky) on GOG.

The Steam version has a few more features that make use of an internet connection. For example, daily challenges, achievements, and leaderboards to compare your scores with your friends and other players around the world. Buy the GOG-version if you want to support the DRM-free movement. (Although the Steam version is DRM-free as well!)

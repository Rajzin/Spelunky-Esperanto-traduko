[*(klaku Ä‰i tie por klarigoj en Esperanto)*](per-simpla-instalo.md)

### Summary

Go [here](https://github.com/Rajzin/Spelunky-Esperanto-traduko/releases/) and download the most recent zip file with the name "Spelunky_EO-traduko_[versionnumber].zip"

Go to the folder where you have Spelunky installed, and in the folder "Data", make backups of the files in the folders "Localization" and "Textures". To install, take the folders "Localization" and "Textures" from the zip file, and put them in the folder ".../Spelunky/Data". To uninstall, put the backed up files back in their original location.

### Detailed steps

1. Make sure that you have Spelunky installed, via Steam or GOG. (Preferably without other mods installed)
2. Go to the most recent release at [github.com/Rajzin/Spelunky-Esperanto-traduko/releases/](https://github.com/Rajzin/Spelunky-Esperanto-traduko/releases/), and download the zip file with the name "Spelunky_EO-traduko_[versionnumber].zip"
3. Go to the folder in your computer where you have Spelunky installed. (If you installed it with Steam, the default location is **C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Spelunky**. If you installed it with GOG, the default location is **C:\GOG Games\Spelunky**)
4. Go to ...\Spelunky\Data\, and make a new folder called "backups".
5. Copy the folders "Localization" and "Textures" from the folder "Data", and paste them in the folder "backups".
6. Open the zip file you downloaded with the Esperanto translation, copy the folders "Localization" and "Textures" from inside, and paste them in the folder ...\Spelunky\Data\. Accept that the new files replace the old ones.
7. Done!

Open Spelunky as usual, and it'll work.

If before installing the mod you played Spelunky in another language than English, you have to go to the settings and change the language to Esperanto there.

### How to update

If there's a new version of the translation released, but you already installed the mod through simple installation, here's the easiest way to update your game:
1. Download the latest version of "strings.pct" at [github.com/Rajzin/Spelunky-Esperanto-traduko/releases/](https://github.com/Rajzin/Spelunky-Esperanto-traduko/releases/)
2. Go to the folder where you have Spelunky installed, and put the new version of "strings.pct" in the folder ...\Spelunky\Data\Localization

### How to uninstall

If you installed the mod following the steps described above, and you want to uninstall the mod to restore the English version of the game:
1. Go to ...\Spelunky\Data\backups, and copy the folders "Localization" and "Textures".
2. Go to ...\Spelunky\Data, and paste the backups in the folder "Data". Accept that the new files replace the old ones.
